            These are few examples to show how easy it is to build Aria Ready UI Widgets. These examples uses <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap. Like Bootstrap</a>.<br>
            There are plenty of UI Framework Libraries like this; <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap/"> UI BootStrap</a> by <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/">Angular JS</a>, <a href="http://www.yaml.de/">Yaml</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a>, etc.. 
            You could track some of them here at <a href="http://www.jsdb.io/">JSDB</a> , which is a collection of JavaScript Libraries and of course on github..
         </p>
         <p>   
            The problem with these libraries, is that they are not specifically designed to be accessible from the start. The result is a negative impact across millions of pages across the web, as inaccessible components are repeatedly shared and incorporated into new projects daily.<br>

            Their main focus is on cross devices (RWD) , but not cross users (Responsible Web Design). <br>
            It would be lovely if they can give the Most out of this rich experience to People With Disabilities (PWD) who used Assistive Technologies(AT) like Screen readers, Magnifiers etc.
            Yes Not Just Cross Browsers and Cross Devices but <strong>Cross Users</strong> as well.. 
    
         </p> 

        <p>
             These examples are a clone of Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2 and Accessibillity fixes applied on top of them. 
            The Idea is based on the work by <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/" class="">The Paciello Group (TPG)</a>. When they felt that the JQuery UI was not Accessibile. They showcased these  examples ((http://hanshillen.github.com/jqtest/#goto_slider) ) . As a result, most of the JQuery examples are accessibile now.
